# IAProject

Project of artificial intelligence of M1 MIAGE DAUPHINE realized by HOUMEL Idir and MESSALI Nassim.
The goal of the project is to build an image as similar as possible to a target image. In particular
we have to find an image that will be as similar as possible to Leonardo da Vinci's painting "Mona Lisa"
using at most 50 convex polygons. 

To launch our program, just run the Mona Lisa class located in the ImageProcessing package. You will then be able to choose the value of the different ratios, the size of the population (for the genetic algorithm), the number of neighbors (for the HillClimbing algorithm), as well as the desired threshold to stop the different algorithms.
